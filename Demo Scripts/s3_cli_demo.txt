S3 CLI Demo

Demonstrates:
  S3 Endpoint (to avoid public bucket access)
  cURL an Object
  S3 Delete Markers
  S3 Versioning
  CLI: S3 versus S3api
  
Prerequisites:
  S3 Bucket with Versioning Enabled
  A simple text file that will cURL nicely
  AWS CLI and cURL installed
  EC2 instance (Possibly Cloud9) to use CLI from
  Network access between the instance and S3api
  
Script:
  Log in to the instance.
  Run: aws s3 ls
  Run: aws s3api list-buckets
  Explain the difference between the low-level and high-level CLIs.

  Copy your bucket name from the above commands.
  BUCKET_NAME=[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE]
  OBJECT_NAME=[YOUR_OBJECT_NAME_HERE]
    Author Note: I use a simple text file called "hello.txt".
  Run: aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket $BUCKET_NAME
    We're checking to make sure that versioning is enabled.
  Show the URL for the object in the browser and copy it.
  Explain why the object can't be retrieved in this way (because of the bucket permissions).
  Optional: Show and explain the bucket policy.
  OBJECT_URL=[YOUR_OBJECT_URL_HERE]
  Say: Let's look at the content of this object from our instance.
  Run: curl $OBJECT_URL
  Explain why the cURL did work in constrast.
  Say: Now we'll download the object and view its metadata with a GET command.
  Run: sudo aws s3api get-object --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --key $OBJECT_NAME $OBJECT_NAME
    Author Note: It's not a typo to repeat the object.
  Say: And we can view what versions of it exist.
  Run: sudo aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --prefix $OBJECT_NAME
  Say: I recently hired an intern. They're great but a little new to all of this. And they're going to accidentally delete the object.
  Run: sudo aws s3api delete-object --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --key $OBJECT_NAME
  Say: Poof! It's gone. A cURL to the object would fail now.
  Run: curl $OBJECT_URL
  Say: But if we look at our object versions...
  Run: sudo aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --prefix $OBJECT_NAME
  Say: The object actally still exists, there's just a delete marker now defined as the latest object version. So our commands will fail by default.
  Copy the VersionId of the delete marker.
  Say: So what I can do, only because versioning is enabled, is delete the delete marker by specifying the delete command its version id.
  Paste in to prompt: sudo aws s3api delete-object --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --key $OBJECT_NAME --version-id {VERSION_ID_OF_DELETE_MARKER}
  Paste in the VersionId.
    It looks like this: dQS7PZuIkVVsOIZ0C0iDh89bdWFBhckK.
  Run the constructed command.
  Say: Now the delete marker is gone.
  Run: sudo aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --prefix $OBJECT_NAME
  Run: curl $OBJECT_URL
  Say: And now my object is restored.
